# GreenLM: Investigating the Energy Implications of Different Language Model Designs

## **Abstract**

The exponential growth in the adoption of large language models (LLMs) has brought about significant advancements in natural language processing but has also raised critical concerns regarding their energy consumption and environmental impact. This study systematically investigates the energy implications of various language model architectures during both training and inference phases, with a focus on identifying patterns and strategies for improved energy efficiency. We analyze key metrics, including cumulative energy consumption, carbon footprint, and performance trade-offs (e.g., accuracy, latency, and throughput), across diverse architectures, ranging from small-scale to state-of-the-art models. Employing standardized experimental setups and energy profiling tools, we quantify the environmental costs associated with these models and explore architectural features and optimization strategies that enhance energy efficiency.
